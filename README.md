Bucket Simple Server Helm Charts

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add bucket-simple-server https://freepik-company.github.io/bucket-simple-server/
```

You can then run the following command to see the charts.

```console
helm search repo bucket-simple-server
```

## How to contribute

For doing it you must:
* Fork the repository
* Make your changes to the code in a specific branch
* Open a PR

> The charts will be reviewed and tested (always)

## Motivation

This project was created to solve a common problem: securely sharing reports and small files without exposing an entire storage bucket. 

Setting up a complex proxy like Envoy is time-consuming and often requires crafting custom plugins to connect to different storage services. While Envoy is great for large-scale projects, this lightweight solution is perfect for smaller needs, such as automated
reports, etc.

Itâ€™s simple, focused, and easy to use, making secure file sharing much easier.

## Flags

As every configuration parameter can be defined in the config file, there are only few flags that can be defined.
They are described in the following table:

| Name              | Description                    |    Default    | Example                  |
|:------------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------:|:-------------------------|
| `--config`        | Path to the YAML config file   | `config.yaml` | `--config ./config.yaml` |
| `--log-level`     | Verbosity level for logs       |    `info`     | `--log-level info`       |
| `--disable-trace` | Disable showing traces in logs |    `info`     | `--log-level info`       |

> Output is thrown always in JSON as it is more suitable for automations

```console
bss run \
    --log-level=info
    --config="./config.yaml"
```

## Examples

Here you have a complete example. More up-to-date one will always be maintained in 
`docs/prototypes` directory [here](./docs/prototypes)


```yaml
version: v1alpha1
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: access-to-reports
spec:
  # Source of data to be served. 
  # This section can be extended to support other sources like S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.
  source:
    gcs:
      bucket: general-purposes-bucket
      credentials:
        path: /tmp/credentials.json

  # Web server configuration
  # Here it's the place to define the server configuration like port, host, credentials, etc.
  webServer:
    listener:
      port: 9090
      host: localhost

    # Several credentials can be defined
    credentials:
      - type: "bearer"
        token: "12345xxxx12345"

      - type: "bearer"
        token: "6789yyyy6789"
      
      - type: "bearer"
        token: "${TOKEN_FROM_ENV}"

    # Routes must be defined to allow access to the data
    # They are defined as golang regular expressions
    # Remember: negative lookbehind is not supported
    allowedTargets:
      - route: "^/qa-reports/(.*).json$"
      - route: "^/pipelines-results/(.*).json$"

```

> ATTENTION:
> If you detect some mistake on the config, open an issue to fix it. This way we all will benefit
